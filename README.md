## What is the duck radio ?

Hello ! Welcome. Want to vibe to good music ?
It's right here : https://radio.letonet.fr/

This is a project between 3 great minds to patch together a fun experience :
- Duck (He is the duck, this is the radio !)
- Eva makes the website beautiful
- And Leto makes it all function.

## Can I contribute ?

Of course you can ! The radio is supported by an external IceCast2 server (That you can see here https://radio.letonet.fr:3000).
As long as you know how to shape a website, please do not hesitate to drop your grain of salt !

## I just merged, why isn't it showing ?

This repository is pulled every minute on our machine. Be patient !
